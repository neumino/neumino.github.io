Their lives have changed, their families have grown and new and unexpected characters have come to unsettle their daily lives and trigger a chain of events that will make them realize that modesty has been replaced by public disclosure; sex is only an app away; but love...love is still something elusive that everyone in today&#39;s banal and chaotic world is seeking.
