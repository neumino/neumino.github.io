### The Immortal
*Released on 2019-12-05, vote average 7.5*

Ciro&#39;s body is sinking in the dark waters of the Gulf of Naples. And as it sinks deeper and deeper, memories emerge. The sounds muffled by the water merge with the screams of fleeing people. It is 1980, the earth shakes, the palace collapses, but under the rubble you can hear the cry of a newborn baby still alive. Ten years later, we find that new-born baby as it survives as it can on the streets of Naples, nobody&#39;s son. Vivid memories of a criminal education that made him what he is: Ciro Di Marzio, the Immortal. Prequel of the &#34;Gomorra&#34; tv show.
