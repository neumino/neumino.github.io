### The Hunt
*Released on 2020-03-11, vote average 7*

In this subversive satire, a group of liberal elites gather for the very first time at a remote Manor House to hunt Trump Supporters (referred to as &#34;Deplorables&#34;) for sport. But the elites&#39; master plan is about to be derailed because one of The Hunted, Crystal (Betty Gilpin, GLOW), knows The Hunters&#39; game better than they do. She turns the tables on the killers, picking them off one by one as she makes her way toward the mysterious woman (two-time Oscar® winner Hilary Swank) at the center of it all.

### Stargirl
*Released on 2020-03-10, vote average 7.9*

Leo Borlock is an average student at Mica High School. He gets decent grades, is a member of the school&#39;s marching band and has always been content flying under the radar. But all that changes when he meets Stargirl Caraway, a confident and colorful new student with a penchant for the ukulele, who stands out in a crowd. She is kind, finds magic in the mundane and touches the lives of others with the simplest of gestures. Her eccentricities and infectious personality charm Leo and the student body, and she quickly goes from being ignored and ridiculed to accepted and praised, then back again, sending Leo on a rollercoaster ride of emotions.
