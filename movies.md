*Released on 2018-02-02, vote average 4.8*

In August 2015, an ISIS terrorist boarded train #9364 from Brussels to Paris.

Stone was a martial arts enthusiast and airman first class in the U.S. Air Force, Skarlatos was a member of the Oregon National Guard, and all three pals proved fearless as they charged and ultimately overpowered the gunman after he emerged from a bathroom armed and ready to kill.
