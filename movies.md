### Foxtrot Six
*Released on 2019-02-21, vote average 8*

Escalating climate change is turning the world economy upside down. With crops dying and food price spiking, FOOD has replaced oil as the world&#39;s most valuable commodity.  Among the very few lands still left fertile, Indonesia is quickly rising as the next economic superpower, when its government is suddenly and ruthlessly overtaken by a popular rogue political party.  In just three days, six former Marines must work together, find their long-lost brotherhood, stop a nationwide government- sanctioned genocide, and save millions of lives, for one last shot at redemption. Or die trying.
