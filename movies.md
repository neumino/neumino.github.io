### Handsome: A Netflix Mystery Movie
*Released on 2017-05-05, vote average 6.7*

A Netflix Mystery Movie, starring Jeff Garlin (&#34;Curb Your Enthusiasm,&#34; &#34;The Goldbergs&#34;) as Gene Handsome, an LA homicide detective who tries to make sense of his life as he solves crime. Handsome’s knack for solving mysteries is matched only by his inability to make sense of his own problems. The film, which is also written and directed by Garlin and co-written by Andrea Seigel, is a lo-fi, Columbo-style mystery comedy. It co-stars Natasha Lyonne, Amy Sedaris, Christine Woods, Steven Weber, Eddie Pepitone and Leah Remini.

### Batman &amp; Bill
*Released on 2017-05-06, vote average 8*

Everyone thinks that Bob Kane created Batman, but that’s not the whole truth. One author makes it his crusade to make it known that Bill Finger, a struggling writer, actually helped invent the iconic superhero, from concept to costume to the very character we all know and love. Bruce Wayne may be Batman’s secret identity, but his creator was always a true mystery.
