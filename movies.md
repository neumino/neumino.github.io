*Released on 2016-11-04, vote average 4.75*

After retiring from his life as an outlaw, ranch owner Nathaniel Reed (Trace Adkins) quietly leads an honest existence with his devoted wife, Laura Lee.

After a violent shootout brings tragic consequences, Nathaniel returns to his old ways and becomes Texas Jack: the most wanted outlaw in the West. Judd Nelson also stars in this action-packed quest for redemption filled with galloping getaways, a beautiful bounty hunter and the possibility of a second chance.
