### Bad Kids of Crestview Academy

It&#39;s four years later, and a new group of students has been placed in Saturday detention at the infamous and prestigious Crestview Academy. When Siouxsie, sophomore &#39;undercrust,&#39; crashes the party to avenge her sister&#39;s death, a Saturday detention reserved for the privileged seniors of Crestview Academy turns into a date in hell. It&#39;s not long before a naïve pussycat lover, gay drug dealer, smokin&#39; hot preacher&#39;s daughter, squeaky-clean senator&#39;s son, and the uninvited younger outsider find themselves locked-up in school with no way out, wondering who (or what) has set them up. Hilarity and suspense ensue while each &#39;bad kid&#39; pits one against the other, and one by one each falls victim to absurdly gruesome &#39;accidents&#39; while trying to escape.
