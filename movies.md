### Anon
*Released on 2018-05-03, vote average 6*

Set in a near-future world where there is no privacy, ignorance or anonymity, our private memories are recorded and crime almost ceases to exist.

Sal realizes it may not be the end of crime but the beginning. Known only as &#39;The Girl&#39;, Sal must find her before he becomes the next victim.
