### In Dubious Battle
*Released on 2017-02-17, vote average 4*

In the California apple country, nine hundred migratory workers rise up &#34;in dubious battle&#34; against the landowners. The group takes on a life of its own-stronger than its individual members and more frightening. Led by the doomed Jim Nolan, the strike is founded on his tragic idealism-on the &#34;courage never to submit or yield.&#34; Published in 1936, In Dubious Battle is considered the first major work of Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Steinbeck.
