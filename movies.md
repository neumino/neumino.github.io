### Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore
*Released on 2022-04-07, vote average 3.5*

In an effort to thwart Grindelwald&#39;s plans of raising pure-blood wizards to rule over all non-magical beings, Albus Dumbledore enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, though he&#39;s unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.
