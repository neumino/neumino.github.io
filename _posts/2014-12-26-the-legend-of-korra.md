I just watched the four seasons of [The Legend of Korra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Korra),
a sequel to [Avatar: The Last Airbender](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender),
and it is a damn good cartoon.

The writers did a tremendous job. It felt a bit special (strange?) to me at the
beginning not because Korra, the main character is a heroine, but because she
is a person looking and forging her own path. The process is messy, and there
is not a clear distinction between good and evil, like in the cartoons and
animes I grew up with. This ambiguity probably made the cartoon more
interesting as it was slightly harder to guess how things would turn
out.

That being said, the story is well written and I quickly became addicted.
As I grew attached to the characters, the cartoon dealt with more and more
sensitive topics like social inequalities, war, post-traumatic stress disorder and eventually LGBT.

While I do not expect children to read too much between the lines,
or one day quote *The Legend of Korra* in an argument about social inequalities,
this cartoon is still for them a first exposure to some of today sensitive topics.
Hopefully it will help them open their mind.

It was definitively worth my time.
