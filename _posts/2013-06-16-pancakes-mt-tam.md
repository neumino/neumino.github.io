West Inn does some pancakes a few times per year -- Checkout <a href="http://westpointinn.com/activities/pancake-breakfasts/">http://westpointinn.com/activities/pancake-breakfasts/</a>.

I went there with a road bike and even if there is a little part of dirt, it's totally doable. I went there with some 23mm tires. From San Francisco, it's about 3600 feet in elevation in total.
You can also just drive there then hike a little.

It's really nice to get pancakes there, you have an awesome view (you can see SF in the clouds, the bay and the ocean), and after a little effort, it tastes even better. Adding some company like today makes it better too.

I'll go for pancakes next time for sure :-)
