I just finished reading _The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language_
by Steven Pinker.

It is a fascinating book that presents some quite interesting theories and facts
about language that I was not aware of - I for example, never thought of language
as a human instinct,


Being a non native English speaker, some examples were a little tricky to get,
but overall the book is easy to read, full of examples, and just too engaging
- I read the whole book during my flight from San Francisco to Hong Kong.

If you are curious about things and want to read something interesting, give it
a try, you will not regret it.
