Thinky 1.15.1 just got released! Sorry for the wait, I was quite busy
these last weeks. Here is what comes with this new release:

- More readable code
  - Running tests now takes about 30 seconds instead of 3 minutes. This
    is mostly because tests now re-use the same tables.
  - Some big and cumbersome methods have been refactored in smaller ones
    like `save`, `hooks` etc.

- Better Performance, a simple benchmark that creates/validates documents
runs about 3 times faster:
  - The code was optimized for v8 `try/catch`, `bind`, etc.
  - Generating virtual fields does not require a full traversal of a document,
    the comlexity being now `O(n)` where `n` is the number of virtual fields.
    The same goes for fields with default values. This was first mentioned by
    [@colprog](https://github.com/colprog) via the [pull request 139](https://github.com/neumino/thinky/pull/139)
  - Less copying for documents and options.

- Some bug fixes:
  - [#134](https://github.com/neumino/thinky/issues/134) -- `save` should not
  remove some foreign keys
  - [#137](https://github.com/neumino/thinky/issues/137) -- `enforce_extra: remove`
  should not save the fields in the database, not just hide them.

One important note is that now, we have the following behavior:

```js
var values = {name: "Michel"};
var user = new User(values);
assert.strictEqual(user, values); // This used to be false before

// But do not worry, this still holds true
var userCopy = new User(values);
assert.notStrictEqual(user, userCopy);
```

About the next steps, there are two interesting things coming:

- Introduce a new way to declare schema, sometihng similar to
[hapi/joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) and unify the schema
under the hood. This should eventually provide sightly better
performance.
- RethinkDB 1.16 is close, and it introduces point change feeds,
meaning that thinky will be able to provide a document that will
automatically update and emit an event when it is the case.  
This will probably come with a light module that will automatically
hook thinky to [sockjs](https://github.com/sockjs). This is going
to be pretty cool, trust me :)
