Hello World!

I am Michel Tu, a French born Chinese guy living in the bay area. where I am
working for Google (previously at [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com)) after
graduating from [Tsinghua](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/newthuen/)
(Beijing) and [Ecole Centrale Paris](http://www.ecp.fr/).

This is a little blog that I use to write down personal notes and other random thoughts.

The blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (and [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)),
[iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com) and is hosted on [Github](http://github.com).
