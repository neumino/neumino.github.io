Hello World!

I am Michel, a French born Chinese guy &mdash; I think that is how we say, I basically look like
a Chinese guy and value cheese and wine more than many things.

I am currently living in [San Francisco](https://www.google.com/maps/preview#!q=san+francisco&data=!4m10!1m9!4m8!1m3!1d379840!2d116.3974589!3d39.9388838!3m2!1i1592!2i745!4f13.1)
, working for Google (previously at [RethinkDB](http://www.rethinkdb.com)) after having studied (hard?) in

This is a little blog that I use to convey my feelings to the world &mdash; or to just write down random thoughts.


The blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (and [JekyllBootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/)),
[iconmonstr](http://iconmonstr.com) and is hosted on [Github](http://github.com).
